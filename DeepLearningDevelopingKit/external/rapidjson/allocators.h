// Allocator

/*! \class rapidjson::Allocator
    \brief Concept for allocating, resizing and freeing memory block.
    
    Note that Malloc() and Realloc() are non-static but Free() is static.
    
    So if an allocator need to support Free(), it needs to put its pointer in 
    the header of memory block.

\code
concept Allocator {
    static const bool kNeedFree;    //!< Whether this allocator needs to call Free().

    // Allocate a memory block.
