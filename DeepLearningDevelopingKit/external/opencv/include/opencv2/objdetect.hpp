@defgroup objdetect Object Detection

Haar Feature-based Cascade Classifier for Object Detection
----------------------------------------------------------

The object detector described below has been initially proposed by Paul Viola @cite Viola01 and
improved by Rainer Lienhart @cite Lienhart02 .

First, a classifier (namely a *cascade of boosted classifiers working with haar-like features*) is
trained with a few hundred sample views of a particular object (i.e., a face or a car), called
positive examples, that are scaled to the same size (say, 20x20), and negative examples - arbitrary
images of the same size.

After a classifier is trained, it can be applied to a region of interest (of the same size as used
during the training) in an input image. The classifier outputs a "1" if the region is likely to show
the object (i.e., face/car), and "0" otherwise. To search for the object in the whole image one can
move the search window across the image and check every location using the classifier. The
classifier is designed so that it can be easily "resized" in order to be able to find the objects of
interest at different sizes, which is more efficient than resizing the image itself. So, to find an
object of an unknown size in the image the scan procedure should be done several times at different
scales.

The word "cascade" in the classifier name means that the resultant classifier consists of several
simpler classifiers (*stages*) that are applied subsequently to a region of interest until at some
stage the candidate is rejected or all the stages are passed. The word "boosted" means that the
classifiers at every stage of the cascade are complex themselves and they are built out of basic
classifiers using one of four different boosting techniques (weighted voting). Currently Discrete
Adaboost, Real Adaboost, Gentle Adaboost and Logitboost are supported. The basic classifiers are
decision-tree classifiers with at least 2 leave
