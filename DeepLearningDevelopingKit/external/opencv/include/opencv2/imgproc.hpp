    @defgroup imgproc_filter Image Filtering

Functions and classes described in this section are used to perform various linear or non-linear
filtering operations on 2D images (represented as Mat's). It means that for each pixel location
\f$(x,y)\f$ in the source image (normally, rectangular), its neighborhood is considered and used to
compute the response. In case of a linear filter, it is a weighted sum of pixel values. In case of
morphological operations, it is the minimum or maximum values, and so on. The computed response is
stored in the destination image at the same location \f$(x,y)\f$. It means that the output image
will be of the same size as the input image. Normally, the functions support multi-channel arrays,
in which case every channel is processed independently. Therefore, the output image will also have
the same number of channels as the input one.

Another common feature of the functions and classes described in this section is that, unlike
simple arithmetic functions, they need to extrapolate values of some non-existing pixels. For
example, if you want to smooth an image using a Gaussian \f$3 \times 3\f$ filter, then, when
processing the left-most pixels in each row, you need pixels to the left of them, that is, outside
of the image. You can let these pixels be the same as the left-most image pixels ("replicated
border" extrapolation method), or assume that all the non-existing pixels are zeros ("constant
border" extrapolation method), and so on. OpenCV enables you to specify the extrapolation method.
For details, see #BorderTypes

@anchor filter_depths
### Depth combinations
Input depth (src.depth()) | Output depth (ddepth)
--------------------------|----------------------
CV_8U                     | -1/CV_16S/CV_32F/CV_64F
CV_16U/CV_16S             | -1/CV_32F/CV_64F
CV_32F                    | -1/CV_32F/CV_64F
CV_64F                    | -1/CV_64F

@note when ddepth=-1, the output image will have the same depth as the source.

    @defgroup imgproc_transform Geometric Image Transformations

The functions in this section perform various geometrical transformations of 2D images. They do not
change the image content but deform the pixel grid and map this deformed grid to the destination
image. In fact, to avoid sampling artifacts, the mapping is done in the reverse order, from
destination to the source. That is, for each pixel \f$(x, y)\f$ of the destination image, the
functions compute coordinates of the corresponding "donor" pixel in the source image and copy the
pixel value:

\f[\texttt{dst} (x,y)= \texttt{src} (f_x(x,y), f_y(x,y))\f]

In case when you specify the forward mapping \f$\left<g_x, g_y\right>: \texttt{src} \rightarrow
\texttt{dst}\f$, the OpenCV functions first compute the corresponding inverse mapping
\f$\left<f_x, f_y\right>: \texttt{dst} \rightarrow \texttt{src}\f$ and then use the above formula.

The actual implementations of the geometrical transformations, from the most generic remap and to
the simplest and the fastest resize, need to solve two main problems with the above formula:

- Extrapolation of non-existing pixels. Similarly to the filtering functions described in the
previous section, for some \f$(x,y)\f$, either one of \f$f_x(x,y)\f$, or \f$f_y(x,y)\f$, or both
of them may fall outside of the image. In this case, an extrapolation method needs to be used.
OpenCV provides the same selection of extrapolation methods as in the filtering functions. In
addition, it provides the method #BORDER_TRANSPARENT. This means that the corresponding pixels in
the destination image will not be modified at all.

- Interpolation of pixel values. Usually \f$f_x(x,y)\f$ and \f$f_y(x,y)\f$ are floating-point
numbers. This means that \f$\left<f_x, f_y\right>\f$ can be either an affine or perspective
transformation, or radial lens distortion correction, and so on. So, a pixel value at fractional
coordinates needs to be retrieved. In the simplest case, the coordinates can be just rounded to the
nearest integer coordinates and the corresponding pixel can be used. This is called a
nearest-neighbor interpolation. However, a better result can be achieved by using more
sophisticated [interpolation methods](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_interpolation) ,
where a polynomial function is fit into some neighborhood of the computed pixel \f$(f_x(x,y),
f_y(x,y))\f$, and then the value of the polynomial at \f$(f_x(x,y), f_y(x,y))\f$ is taken as the
interpolated pixel value. In OpenCV, you can choose between several interpolation methods. See
resize for details.

@note The geometrical transformations do not work with `CV_8S` or `CV_32S` images.

    @defgroup imgproc_misc Miscellaneous Image Transformations
    @defgroup imgproc_draw Drawing Functions

Drawing functions work with matrices/images of arbitrary depth. The boundaries of the shapes can be
rendered with antialiasing (implemented only for 8-bit images for now). All the functions include
the parameter color that uses an RGB value (that may be constructed with the Scalar constructor )
for color images and brightness for grayscale images. For color images, the channel ordering is
normally *Blue, Green, Red*. This is what imshow, imread, and imwrite expect. So, if you form a
color using the Scalar constructor, it should look like:

\f[\texttt{Scalar} (blue \_ component, green \_ component, red \_ component[, alpha \_ component])\f]

If you are using your own image rendering and I/O functions, you can use any channel ordering. The
drawing functions process each channel independently and do not depend on the channel order or even
on the used color space. The whole image can be converted from BGR to RGB or to a different color
space using cvtColor .

If a drawn figure is partially or completely outside the image, the drawing functions clip it. Also,
many drawing functions can handle pixel coordinates specified with sub-pixel accuracy. This means
that the coordinates can be passed as fixed-point numbers encoded as integers. The number of
fractional bits is specified by the shift parameter and the real point coordinates are calculated as
\f$\texttt{Point}(x,y)\rightarrow\texttt{Point2f}(x*2^{-shift},y*2^{-shift})\f$ . This feature is
especially effective when rendering antialiased shapes.

@note The functions do not support alpha-transparency when the target image is 4-channel. In this
case, the color[3] is simply copied to the repainted pixels. Thus, if you want to paint
semi-transparent shapes, you can paint them in a separate buffer and then blend it with the main
image.

    @defgroup imgproc_colormap ColorMaps in OpenCV

The human perception isn't built for observing fine changes in grayscale images. Human eyes are more
sensitive to observing changes between colors, so you often need to recolor your grayscale images to
get a clue about them. OpenCV now comes with various colormaps to enhance the visualization in your
computer vision application.

In OpenCV you only need applyColorMap to apply a colormap on a given image. The following sample
code reads the path to an image from command line, applies a Jet colormap on it and shows the
result:

@code
#include <opencv2/core.hpp>
#include <opencv2/imgproc.hpp>
#include <opencv2/imgcodecs.hpp>
#include <opencv2/highgui.hpp>
using namespace cv;

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main(int argc, const char *argv[])
{
    // We need an input image. (can be grayscale or color)
    if (argc < 2)
    {
        cerr << "We need an image to process here. Please run: colorMap [path_to_image]" << endl;
        return -1;
    }
    Mat img_in = imread(argv[1]);
    if(img_in.empty())
    {
        cerr << "Sample image (" << argv[1] << ") is empty. Please adjust your path, so it points to a valid input image!" << endl;
        return -1;
    }
    // Holds the colormap version of the image:
    Mat img_color;
    // Apply the colormap:
    applyColorMap(img_in, img_color, COLORMAP_JET);
    // Show the result:
    imshow("colorMap", img_color);
    waitKey(0);
    return 0;
}
@endcode

    @defgroup imgproc_subdiv2d Planar Subdivision

The Subdiv2D class described in this section is used to perform various planar subdivision on
a set of 2D points (represented as vector of Point2f). OpenCV subdivides a plane into triangles
using the Delaunay's algorithm, which corresponds to the dual graph of the Voronoi diagram.
In the figure below, the Delaunay's triangulation is marked with black lines and the Voronoi
diagram with red lines.

![Delaunay triangulation (black) and Voronoi (red)](pics/delaunay_voronoi.png)

The subdivisions can be used for the 3D piece-wise transformation of a plane, morphing, fast
location of points on the plane, building special graphs (such as NNG,RNG), and so forth.
