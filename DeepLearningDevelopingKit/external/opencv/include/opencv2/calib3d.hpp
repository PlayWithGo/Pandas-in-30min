  @defgroup calib3d Camera Calibration and 3D Reconstruction

The functions in this section use a so-called pinhole camera model. In this model, a scene view is
formed by projecting 3D points into the image plane using a perspective transformation.

\f[s  \; m' = A [R|t] M'\f]

or

\f[s  \vecthree{u}{v}{1} = \vecthreethree{f_x}{0}{c_x}{0}{f_y}{c_y}{0}{0}{1}
\begin{bmatrix}
r_{11} & r_{12} & r_{13} & t_1  \\
r_{21} & r_{22} & r_{23} & t_2  \\
r_{31} & r_{32} & r_{33} & t_3
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
X \\
Y \\
Z \\
1
\end{bmatrix}\f]

where:

-   \f$(X, Y, Z)\f$ are the coordinates of a 3D point in the world coordinate space
-   \f$(u, v)\f$ are the coordinates of the projection point in pixels
-   \f$A\f$ is a camera matrix, or a matrix of intrinsic parameters
-   \f$(cx, cy)\f$ is a principal point that is usually at the image center
-   \f$fx, fy\f$ are the focal lengths expressed in pixel units.

Thus, if an image from the camera is scaled by a factor, all of these parameters should be scaled
(multiplied/divided, respectively) by the same factor. The matrix of intrinsic parameters does not
depend on the scene viewed. So, once estimated, it can be re-used as long as the focal length is
fixed (in case of zoom lens). The joint rotation-translation matrix \f$[R|t]\f$ is called a matrix of
extrinsic parameters. It is used to describe the camera motion around a static scene, or vice versa,
rigid motion of an object in front of a still camera. That is, \f$[R|t]\f$ translates coordinates of a
point \f$(X, Y, Z)\f$ to a coordinate system, fixed with respect to the camera. The transformation above
is equivalent to the following (when \f$z \ne 0\f$ ):

\f[\begin{array}{l}
\vecthree{x}{y}{z} = R  \vecthree{X}{Y}{Z} + t \\
x' = x/z \\
y' = y/z \\
u = f_x*x' + c_x \\
v = f_y*y' + c_y
\end{array}\f]

The following figure illustrates the pinhole camera model.

![Pinhole camera model](pics/pinhole_camera_model.png)

Real lenses usually have some distortion, mostly radial distortion and slight tangential distortion.
So, the above model is extended as:

\f[\begin{array}{l}
\vecthree{x}{y}{z} = R  \vecthree{X}{Y}{Z} + t \\
x' = x/z \\
y' = y/z \\
x'' = x'  \frac{1 + k_1 r^2 + k_2 r^4 + k_3 r^6}{1 + k_4 r^2 + k_5 r^4 + k_6 r^6} + 2 p_1 x' y' + p_2(r^2 + 2 x'^2) + s_1 r^2 + s_2 r^4 \\
y'' = y'  \frac{1 + k_1 r^2 + k_2 r^4 + k_3 r^6}{1 + k_4 r^2 + k_5 r^4 + k_6 r^6} + p_1 (r^2 + 2 y'^2) + 2 p_2 x' y' + s_3 r^2 + s_4 r^4 \\
\text{where} \quad r^2 = x'^2 + y'^2  \\
u = f_x*x'' + c_x \\
v = f_y*y'' + c_y
\end{array}\f]

\f$k_1\f$, \f$k_2\f$, \f$k_3\f$, \f$k_4\f$, \f$k_5\f$, and \f$k_6\f$ are radial distortion coefficients. \f$p_1\f$ and \f$p_2\f$ are
tangential distortion coefficients. \f$s_1\f$, \f$s_2\f$, \f$s_3\f$, and \f$s_4\f$, are the thin prism distortion
coefficients. Higher-order coefficients are not considered in OpenCV.

The next figure shows two common types of radial distortion: barrel distortion (typically \f$ k_1 > 0 \f$ and pincushion distortion (typically \f$ k_1 < 0 \f$).

![](pics/distortion_examples.png)

In some cases the image sensor may be tilted in order to focus an oblique plane in front of the
camera (Scheimpfug condition). This can be useful for particle image velocimetry (PIV) or
triangulation with a laser fan. The tilt causes a perspective distortion of \f$x''\f$ and
\f$y''\f$. This distortion can be modelled in the following way, see e.g. @cite Louhichi07.

\f[\begin{array}{l}
s\vecthree{x'''}{y'''}{1} =
\vecthreethree{R_{33}(\tau_x, \tau_y)}{0}{-R_{13}(\tau_x, \tau_y)}
{0}{R_{33}(\tau_x, \tau_y)}{-R_{23}(\tau_x, \tau_y)}
{0}{0}{1} R(\tau_x, \tau_y) \vecthree{x''}{y''}{1}\\
u = f_x*x''' + c_x \\
v = f_y*y''' + c_y
\end{array}\f]

where the matrix \f$R(\tau_x, \tau_y)\f$ is defined by two rotations with angular parameter \f$\tau_x\f$
and \f$\tau_y\f$, respectively,

\f[
R(\tau_x, \tau_y) =
\vecthreethree{\cos(\tau_y)}{0}{-\sin(\tau_y)}{0}{1}{0}{\sin(\tau_y)}{0}{\cos(\tau_y)}
\vecthreethree{1}{0}{0}{0}{\cos(\tau_x)}{\sin(\tau_x)}{0}{-\sin(\tau_x)}{\cos(\tau_x)} =
\vecthreethree{\cos(\tau_y)}{\sin(\tau_y)\sin(\tau_x)}{-\sin(\tau_y)\cos(\tau_x)}
{0}{\cos(\tau_x)}{\sin(\tau_x)}
{\sin(\tau_y)}{-\cos(\tau_y)\sin(\tau_x)}{\cos(\tau_y)\cos(\tau_x)}.
\f]

In the functions below the coefficients are passed or returned as

\f[(k_1, k_2, p_1, p_2[, k_3[, k_4, k_5, k_6 [, s_1, s_2, s_3, s_4[, \tau_x, \tau_y]]]])\f]

vector. That is, if the vector contains four elements, it means that \f$k_3=0\f$ . The distortion
coefficients do not depend on the scene viewed. Thus, they also belong to the intrinsic camera
parameters. And they remain the same regardless of the captured image resolution. If, for example, a
camera has been calibrated on images of 320 x 240 resolution, absolutely the same distortion
coefficients can be used for 640 x 480 images from the same camera while \f$f_x\f$, \f$f_y\f$, \f$c_x\f$, and
\f$c_y\f$ need to be scaled appropriately.

The functions below use the above model to do the following:

-   Project 3D points to the image plane given intrinsic and extrinsic parameters.
-   Compute extrinsic parameters given intrinsic parameters, a few 3D points, and their
projections.
-   Estimate intrinsic and extrinsic camera parameters from several views of a known calibration
pattern (every view is described by several 3D-2D point correspondences).
-   Estimate the relative position and orientation of the stereo camera "heads" and compute the
*rectification* transformation that makes the camera optical axes parallel.

    Definitions: Let P be a point in 3D of coordinates X in the world reference frame (stored in the
    matrix X) The coordinate vector of P in the camera reference frame is:

    \f[Xc = R X + T\f]

    where R is the rotation matrix corresponding to the rotation vector om: R = rodrigues(om); call x, y
    and z the 3 coordinates of Xc:

    \f[x = Xc_1 \\ y = Xc_2 \\ z = Xc_3\f]

    The pinhole projection coordinates of P is [a; b] where

    \f[a = x / z \ and \ b = y / z \\ r^2 = a^2 + b^2 \\ \theta = atan(r)\f]

    Fisheye distortion:

    \f[\theta_d = \theta (1 + k_1 \theta^2 + k_2 \theta^4 + k_3 \theta^6 + k_4 \theta^8)\f]

    The distorted point coordinates are [x'; y'] where

    \f[x' = (\theta_d / r) a \\ y' = (\theta_d / r) b \f]
